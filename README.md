## Overview

This is a design to show transistion effect on a navigation menu, just to brushen up my CSS knowledge with understanding and practicing CSS transistion. It is a responsive design which fit in all screen sizes.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
